Contrasting patterns of selection on the size and coloration of a female plumage ornament in common yellowthroats,"['CR Freeman‐Gallant', 'RL Schneider']",2014,Journal of …,Females often possess ornaments that appear smaller and duller than homologous traits in males. These ornaments may arise as nonfunctional by‐products of sexual selection in males and cause negative viability or fecundity selection in females in proportion to the cost
Experimental evidence of condition-dependent sexual dimorphism in the weakly dimorphic antler fly Protopiophila litigata (Diptera: Piophilidae),"['MJ Oudin', 'R Bonduriansky']",2015,Biological Journal of the …,Sexually dimorphic traits have a history of directional selection for exaggeration in at least one sex. Theory suggests that traits targeted by persistent selection should evolve heightened condition dependence whereby their expression reflects the availability and
"Genetic similarity, not male size, influences female mate choice in the agile antechinus (Antechinus agilis)","['ML Parrott', 'SJ Ward']",2006,Australian Journal of …,"Our research investigates the effects of genetic relatedness between mates and male size on female mate choice in the agile antechinus (Antechinus agilis).

Detecting selection on morphological traits in social insect castes: the case of the social wasp Vespula maculifrons,"['JL Kovacs', 'EA Hoffman', 'SM Marriner']",2010,Biological Journal of …,"Highly social insects dominate terrestrial ecosystems because society members belong to discrete castes that undertake distinct tasks. The distinct functional roles of members of different castes may lead to divergent selective regimes, which may ultimately lead to"
Multivariate genetic architecture of the Anolis dewlap reveals both shared and sex‐specific features of a sexually dimorphic ornament,"['RM Cox', 'RA Costello', 'BE Camber']",2017,Journal of …,Darwin viewed the ornamentation of females as an indirect consequence of sexual selection on males and the transmission of male phenotypes to females via the 'laws of inheritance'. Although a number of studies have supported this view by demonstrating substantial
