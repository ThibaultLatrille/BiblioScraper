Don't get drowned in the flood of scientific publications. As a salmon, climb up the stream.

*Salmon Scholar* uses as input a list of seminal publications and finds more recent publications citing all your seminal publications.
*Salmon Scholar* works in 2 steps:

 - From a core bibliography of seminal publications, Salmon Scholar will download independently for each entry the back citations (papers that are citing this entry). 
 - Then Salmon Scholar will merge and sort these back citations, such that the first entries are the papers that are citing the maximum your core bibliography.
 
If problems and/or questions are encountered, feel free to [open issues](https://github.com/ThibaultLatrille/SalmonScholar/issues).

## 0. Local copy

Clone the repository and `cd` to the dir.
```
git clone https://github.com/ThibaultLatrille/SalmonScholar
cd SalmonScholar
```

## 1. Installation

Install python3 packages
```
sudo apt install -qq -y snakemake python3-pandas python3-pip
pip3 install scholarly --user
```

## 2. Setup ScraperAPI

Running the script would make you banned by Google Scholar. Hence, you need to setup proxies using ScraperAPI.
Create an account at https://www.scraperapi.com/ to obtain an API key. 

## 3. Setup the core bibliography

The file `biblio-core.csv` is given as an example.
You can generate our own core bibliography with Zotero (File -> Export Library -> Format: CSV).
This csv file can also be generated by other means, it simply has to contain the column `Key` and `Title`.
The core bibliography can be updated, only the new entries will have the back citations downloaded. 

## 4. Run snakemake

Run `snakemake` with 4 CPU and parameters given as command-line arguments, using ScraperAPI key (replace `XXXXX` with your own API key), input and output files: 
```
snakemake --cores 4 --config SCRAPER_API_KEY=XXXXX INPUT_FILE=biblio-core.csv OUTPUT_FILE=biblio-core-results.csv 
```
